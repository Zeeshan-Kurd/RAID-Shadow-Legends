                                <p>Yes, so the work I'm currently doing is cybersecurity, working as a cybersecurity consultant for a bank. So you're looking for more details around what that job entails, right?</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Alright, just give me a second to just bring up a playbook or a checklist. So with the role it's a consulting role rather than an architectural role. So really, because the bank I'm working with now is Agile-based and has tribes and squads, it's about working with those product owners in the tribe on their initiatives to understand what they're trying to achieve there and support the delivery of that business objective. So part of the work we do is to understand what they're trying to do and identify any specific security requirements for that particular initiative, but it's also about understanding what information is involved in that initiative because in my work it's what information needs protecting, what are the threats to that information, and what are the controls that are in place to protect that information, those information assets we call them. So that's the work I do, specifying requirements, working with architects to ensure that their design incorporates those requirements that I have, and then working through the entire lifecycle to validate those requirements through security testing, through code scanning and the like.</p>

                                <p><b>You said before I started recording, you initially started with a Civil Engineering degree, was it? And then you switched to IT?</b></p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Yeah, so I guess way back then when I finished my engineering degree in 1986, computer science was a very new field and so for me it probably wasn't at the maturity, when I started my degree, for me to commence straight into the computer science field. So I finished my engineering degree but actually I had a great interest in computer-aided design, but it reached a point where my interest was probably more so in computer science and Information technology than it was in engineering. So, after finishing my engineering degree I went back and did a grad dip in computer science and then a Masters in computer science.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p><b>It’s good to hear that you enjoy this more.</b></p>

                                <p>Yeah look it's important to do what you enjoy doing because one it's just the enjoyment factor, but also you tend to be better at what you enjoy doing. Even within information technology, computer science and even now cybersecurity, I’ve done various roles that range from architectural roles, engineering roles and consulting roles, which I'm doing now, but also project management roles. I also have certifications in project management, but I also found out that I actually prefer more hands-on work than doing project management and just herding the cats in terms of getting them to do work because project management is more about planning and getting other people to do the work rather than doing the work yourself, and for me that was less rewarding than having a more hands-on approach.</p>
                            </div>
                            <br>

                                <p><b>Yeah, that's relatable. So you work in cybersecurity, as a consultant, what are the different types of people that you interact with day to day? </b></p>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <div class="text-left">
                                <p>There's a range of different stakeholders. One of them are the product owners that are looking to deliver a new feature or initiative. Associated with the product owner, there are journey experts or business analysts, and I work with them to understand what they're trying to achieve, so I can understand the threats that may exist as part of that initiative. So they're more on the business side, to business stakeholders and then we have initiative leads or release leads (in the Agile world these days we don't call them project managers anymore) that help with the delivery of that feature. Essentially, they are a project manager and my involvement with them as a stakeholder is to ensure that all the activities that are required as part of my playbook are incorporated into that delivery of that feature. So it's the activities I do directly, but also activities that my colleagues perform as well, so I guess one is, security testing of these initiatives before releasing them into production. There are specialized resources that perform that security testing, so I need to ensure that they're part of that release plan. As I touched upon, some of my peers that do specialist activities in the cybersecurity space. So one is pentesting or security testing. That's one of the specialist fields in cybersecurity and another one is code review. That's where we analyse the source code looking for vulnerabilities in that source code and we've also got specialist resources that that that do that as well. Another one I'll mention is application firewalls. So you may be familiar with network firewalls, we also have application firewalls and web application firewalls or WAFs and they provide an additional layer of protection for our applications that are Internet-facing and we have a team of resources that manage our WAFs at the bank I'm working with, so they're sort of three examples of the security specialists that I work with. Part of my role is to ensure that those resources are engaged and informed about what we're trying to deliver so they can apply their specialist skills to the work that's going on in that initiative. </p>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <div class="text-center">
                                <p><b>So you've talked quite a bit about Agile. What would you say are the benefits and drawbacks of working in an Agile environment?</b></p>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <div class="text-left">
                                <p>Being embedded with the Tribes delivering solutions is a far more rewarding role so you feel as though you are a part of that delivery for that initiative and to me that is more rewarding when delivering initiatives that are smaller incremental releases as well. There's no doubt that Agile is the right delivery mechanism for that. You want to improve that time to market for these smaller enhancements to the solution that you've got. Agile is still a challenge for delivering foundation releases, particularly where you've got complex platforms and infrastructure as part of that foundation release. I'm yet to see an effective Agile approach to delivering foundation releases, and maybe other organizations can do that, but for a banking organization, they struggle with that still at this stage, but overall there's no doubt that these traditional waterfall approaches, where it was taking three years to set up a new platform. That wasn't sustainable, when competing with more agile and smaller organizations delivering financial technology.</p>
                            </div>
                            <br>

                                <p><b>What aspects of your work, would you say you find the most challenging?</b></p>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <div class="text-left">
                                <p>It's surprising, It's not the technology, that's easy. That’s just that, dealing with facts and sometimes it may take a little while to understand the details, but for me that's easy because it's rational. Humans are challenging, so part of our role is sometimes telling stakeholders things that they don't want to hear. That they've got some additional requirements they hadn't thought about, or they've got some vulnerabilities and risks they must deal with, that they don't really want to hear about in some cases. It's those softer skills sometimes; to ensure that people are listening and understanding what you're saying. So I will say my role is to help the business make informed decisions about its risk. We all have different risk appetites, and that's fine and for me, I'm not ultimately accepting the risk as part of a solution, but I need to make sure that that the business stakeholders understand that risk that they are accepting. It always takes time to become that trusted advisor, so they will listen to you and that they actually understand the risk. And again, we're back to the risk appetite. We all have different risk appetites. I guess working in cybersecurity though that's I think our risk appetite is probably lesser than what the business' is. So sometimes we do get a little bit frustrated that they're choosing to accept something, whereas I'd be saying no, I probably do want to treat that because I know if the risk is realized, it will be a mad scramble to try and remediate that, and I've certainly seen that a few times, in my career.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p><b>Yeah, I'd imagine. Especially in banking you would want to be as secure as possible. </b></p>

                                <p>Yeah, Nikila, there's no solution that's perfect. And if I can't find some vulnerabilities in a solution, I probably haven't analysed that enough. And it's about what's acceptable. There is also always a residual risk; the cost to have no risk is just prohibitive, so it really relies on your risk appetite.</p>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <div class="text-center">
                                <p><b>How would you say you keep your technology skills current and up to date?</b></p>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <div class="text-left">
                                <p>It’s really so important in our field, even though these cybersecurity principles, even going back to information security principles, really haven't changed a lot in the last 20 years since information security became a real profession. But how you apply those to technology? Because technology is changing rapidly, which is the really important thing. Look at infrastructure as code. That's changed to now where you have infrastructure as code or infrastructure as a service and platform as a service. Let's leave alone SaaS for a second. But 20 years ago we were building hardware in a datacentre. It was me in a datacentre and servers in a datacentre whereas now most organizations would have infrastructure as a service or platform as a service as a priority for them. How do you then understand how to deploy these platforms for example, as infrastructure as code? So to answer your question, it involves ongoing education and certifications; so guys that specialize in cloud security, they would be off and do some more certifications in cloud security, for example. The other thing as well is that you always have to ask questions. I didn't mention before that the other stakeholders are the engineering stakeholders these days and these are very intelligent people, and are also very keen to adopt new technologies because they're interesting for them and so the other way of keeping your skills up to date is that you always have an ongoing dialogue with these other resources and ask lots of questions. I think that the more questions you ask, and the more you listen, the more informed you become. But the important thing is that it's an ongoing education. Your education doesn't stop with your degree at university, you have to keep yourself continually skilled and re-skilled as well.</p>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <div class="text-center">
                                <p><b>Yeah, you've really got to go with the trends. </b></p>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <div class="text-left">
                                <p>Yeah, and you're forced to. For us in cybersecurity, having platforms in a datacentre was somewhat easier for us in terms of that the patterns were well defined, but look at GCP, Google Cloud Platform, there's new services being deployed every month and things going from alpha to beta and what have you, so it's an ongoing effort to keep on top of those new services and assure you apply the controls across those. I will say though, where there are challenges, there are also opportunities. Patch management of servers is a huge issue for the industry. That's the reason there are compromises out there, a lot of it is just poor patching and when you have cloud-based services, infrastructure as a service or PaaS, that solves that problem with patching. In some ways, you're forced to keep taking new updates as part of those environments, so these newer technologies also solve some of the problems that have plagued the cybersecurity space for the last number of years as well.</p>

                                <p>It's not all bad, in fact progressive security consultants are embracing cloud services because there are some security benefits in the adoption of those.</p>

                                <p>COVID has just changed that around in the last year, working from home. It really depends on the tribe that I'm working with that. So I've just moved from a very engineering-heavy tribe to a more business-focused tribe. But say that in that engineering tribe, there are stand-ups, right now it's been dialling into those. But now rather than a traditional meeting, it's very much just messaging, so the bank has adopted Slack, for example. So rather than a formal meeting that you listen to, there are these Slack channels where you can have an interactive conversation via Slack rather than a meeting in a room or even a meeting in Teams. I would say these days, only a third of my time is in meetings, whether it be face to face back in the office or in Teams, so probably a third and, a lot of other time is actually in Teams or Slack, having a conversation with somebody. Whether it be one person or several people, probably a third of the time is engaging in conversation. We're using those as a substitution for not being in the office. If we were in the office, we would be having these sort of corridor conversations rather than these online conversations. So I'd say a third is formal meetings, another third is conversations and then the other third is doing work stand alone.</p>

                                <p>Yeah, it was a big impact to the way that we work. Especially in the work I'm doing, because we do rely on these relationships to get involved in these initiatives and hearing things and say, OK, well, this is where I can help. So yeah, without those sort of corridor conversations, we did rely more upon the messaging technologies, Slack more so for engineering resources, and Teams more so for our business resources.</p>

                                <p>I think I’ve touched on a couple of things. One is that choose a field that's of interest to you. You have to enjoy what you're doing. It's really important, but also pick something that is aligned with your skills. As I said, I've done some project management and I can do it and understand the theory very well. I wasn't enjoying it, and it's not aligned with my skill set. Rather than tell people to do things all the time, I like to do some things myself as well and get into the details myself. You need to find an area that you enjoy but also one that's aligned with your skills. What are you good at? That's probably the thing that's important. And also that your education never stops, your training never stops. That should never stop because if it has, it means you've become less skilled, you've become deskilled, and less valuable in the marketplace. So yeah, I think it's important that you keep your ongoing education and training, so you are more valuable in the marketplace. In terms of breaking into the industry that was sort of the question as well.</p>

                                <p>And this is where for me moving from engineering into computer science that surprisingly, having a personal network is important as well. So a personal and professional network that can look out for you. So lucky I had an old school friend that helped me get my foot in the door when moving from engineering into computer science so my advice is don't overlook anyone who you think may be able to help you get your foot in the door, but also don't be too precious about the very first job you have, either. To have some industry skill/experience is just so important and if you're good at your work, you will soon have more opportunities as well.</p>

                                <p><b>Yeah, I guess it's a lot more who you know rather than what you know, especially in competitive job markets.</b></p>

                                <p>Yeah, that that's been my experience that who you know can be far more advantageous for getting that foot in the door. But then once you have it, you just have to prove yourself. That's the thing, you just need to get that foot in the door, and I guess there are now graduate programs that the larger institutions and consulting firms have. So your top tier four consulting organizations are all taking in graduates as well. That's a great experience; you will certainly be forced to keep on learning if you go and work for one of the top consulting companies. That sets you up for a very good career as well.</p>

                                <p><b>I'm looking at cybersecurity and I’m kind of looking at network engineering.</b></p>

                                <p>Yes, ok, there's no doubt that cybersecurity is a field that just continues to increase as more and more services are moved online. I've been very fortunate with the growth in the industry and the same for network security. A lot of cybersecurity resources have moved over from infrastructure architecture and network architecture into cybersecurity. But what’s most important is doing something that interests you the most. There's no doubt that cybersecurity is one of the absolute growth fields in computer science; the other would be data engineering/data science. But I must say I look at myself and it just doesn't do it for me. It would for others. And that's great but for me, even though I do have an interest in information assets because that's what we look to protect that deeper analysis of the data, but I couldn't be a data scientist but that's certainly another area because businesses now start to realize that data is a product and that they need to get the most out of that product that they possibly can. So that's certainly been another area of great growth in the last time five years.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p><b>I'd imagine cloud computing-related things would also be in demand</b></p>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <div class="text-left">
                                <p>Absolutely. That whole spectrum of resources required to support cloud solutions these days, what we used to call an infrastructure architect, they're now more called platform architects. That's because rather than deploying servers and speccing out servers going to be deployed into a datacentre, it's now about consuming infrastructure as a service and platform as a service. So there are those architectural resources, there are the engineering resources as well to do the actual coding to support those, or to consume services. It’s the same from cybersecurity as well. The range of resources from both an architecture perspective, but also from an engineering perspective. So in the last five years, the concept of a security engineer has evolved. That's probably a good way into cybersecurity, as an engineering-type resource and quite hands-on and then evolve into more of an architectural resource and a consulting resource. They're I guess things to consider as well, in terms of the type of role. Is it a more hands-on engineering role initially and then you evolve from that? I'll show my age, so with computer science 30 years ago, you had this much more formal progression in your career, you were a programmer then an analyst programmer, then a senior analyst programmer and it was a much more formal progression in your career to go through those different levels of computer science resource. It's much less structured now, but there is a little bit of that still, going from engineering roles into architectural roles into consulting roles. I will say as another piece of advice, that's it's always good that even though you may not have a long-term career plan for engineering roles, to have that background is incredibly helpful. Now that I've done software engineering. I've actually cut code professionally. And that still helps me today so even though I'm not cutting code day in day out, I am reviewing code still and know that coding work I did 20 plus years ago is still helping me today.</p>
