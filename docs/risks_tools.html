                        <h2><b>Risks</b><h2>
                        <h3>Scope Risks</h3>
                        <p style="text-align:justify;">Scope risks are the first major constraint that can affect tasks that endanger project orientated goals, deliverables, or our set timeframe. Referring to our scope above the main factor that can be certainly hinder our ability to meet our deadline. The time limit is a major influence on our project which is a discord bot. We only have 6 weeks to produce the bot using the appropriate software's and tools, document our A3 spreadsheet and then add our information into a website for presentation. All of this in such a short amount of time can definitely be a big burden that we need to be conscious of and monitor our progress constantly paying close attention to our project charter and time plan which is an important reference so we can understand how efficient we are and if we are on track to submit and meet our assignment obligations on time. </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Software risks (Licensing and cyber security)</h2>
                        <p style="text-align:justify;">Software risks is also pretty relevant and is affecting our scenario as we do not want to receive any copyright infringements from using unlicensed software that may end in a law suit so we will carefully be using software with permission and using open source publicly available information, not only must we be careful with the software and tools licensing but also making sure that it is safe and secure to use and deploy over the internet. The last thing we want is our discord bot having a reverse shell and SSH’ing into our PC via a backdoor. Meaning some person can breach us and our users and have access to the computers, making sure all third party software we use is safe and secure to use along side with the server hosting the discord bot. </p>

                        <br>
                        <h2><b> Tools </b></h2>
                        <p style="text-align:justify;">For the majority of this assignment, our team had used Microsoft teams and their inbuilt 365 Suite to store and work on our report, primarily using a shared Microsoft Word document to write the bulk of our information before it was formatted for better aesthetics and readability. We had also used Microsoft Teams’ scheduling function to help us stay on track and remind us of meeting date and times.  </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify;">In order to communicate outside of meetings and class, the group had decided on using Facebook Messenger as means to quickly send and message and update group members on any information that is new and well as quickly remind the group of when a meeting is happening. This was done using a group chat. A discord was also created at the beginning of the assignment but has not seen much use as the group decided that Microsoft Teams’ features were adequate.   </p>
                        <p style="text-align:justify;">Using: - MS TEAMs, Discord 0.0.263, GitHub, Facebook Messenger, Visual Studio Code 1.56.2 and Nikila’s A1 Code, Website template from Themefisher.com, Microsoft Word, Docker 20.10.2, Python 3.8.2 and 3.10 (including Docker 5.0.0 and discord.py 1.7.2 modules), Node.js 12 and discord.js 12.5.3, Bash 5, and various inbuilt Python modules </p>
