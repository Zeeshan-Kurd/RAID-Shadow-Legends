                                <p style="text-align:justify;" >Team RAID Shadow Legend’s ideal jobs are largely split into half with two members wishing to become software engineers and the other three wishing to pursue careers in IT systems administration, IT consulting and a leadership position as a CTO. Gathering data from the table, all of the occupations require a bachelor’s degree or higher in order to gain an entry position in their IT related profession. Each role would also be working in some form of team to create or design an IT product or service. A problem-solving mindset alongside the necessary skills to engage challenges are a must have for each occupation as every role will face a different challenge every day at work. The key differences between each of the roles are also divided between software engineering and the other IT careers. Primarily where software engineering works closely on a software level and the other IT occupations work more on a hardware level with the use of some programs and software. Software engineers would also be working on the creation or alteration of products and services whilst those in IT would be working with the products and services which the software engineers create.</p>
