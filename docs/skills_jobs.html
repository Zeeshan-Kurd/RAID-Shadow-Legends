                                        <p style="text-align:justify;">In order to take our project to the next level we will need to have our time and roles managed and organised. If we were to hire a Senior Project Manager, we would be able to be more organised and our work ethic would be considerably more efficient then if we did not have someone overseeing our work. With a senior Manager on our team we will have someone that our team can consult if they have any questions or problems. The senior Manager would organise the group so that everyone will have an adequate amount of work to be completed while at the same time, not overloading any one person. </p>
                                        <p style="text-align:justify;">In order for someone to be classified as a senior project manager, they will need to have had prior experience in IT project management, have broad knowledge in the programming field so that they can act as a consultant for younger group members. They will need the ability to multitask, in order to focus on multiple problems and will need good communication skills so that they can create an efficient working environment. A strong leadership mindset will also be required to lead and maintain the group. </p>

They will help us spread our advertising across different platforms and social medias to gain attention from more audiences. They will be responsible for creating social media accounts on platforms such as Instagram and twitter. As we are creating a discord bot, we will also create a discord server for our customers to discuss and ask questions which the marketer can forward towards us.  </p>
                                        <p style= "text-align:justify;" >In order to qualify for what we seek, the following attributes will be needed; marketing and advertising experience, strong communication skills, multitasking skills for overseeing multiple forms of advertising and marketing. They will not need as much IT knowledge as other employees as their main focus will be marketing. The only knowledge they will need is the basis for our project so they can design the perfect marketing scheme and attract the most desirable customers. Their communication skills are going to be a big requirement for the job as they will be interacting with the customers more than any other person. If they have any experience in the digital marketing field they would already be doing the same interactions on social media. However, if they have no prior experience, they may crack under pressure from the multiple accounts and the overflow of questions from customers.  </p>
