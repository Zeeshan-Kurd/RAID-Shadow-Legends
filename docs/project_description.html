                                <h3 class="text-center" style="text-align:left";>Topic</h3>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>We envision creating a Discord bot that can run (at first) Python code, for use in Computer Science and IT related Discord servers or even private servers for hobbyist use, so that people can collaboratively view python outputs for any commands that are run and also display code that is pulled from a GitHub repository. It will act almost like a pseudo-version of the Python Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE), so that everyone can view the code output at the same time, without the unnecessary bandwidth used by screensharing programs. Upon setting up the bot to run Python, other coding languages will then be integrated to be used with the bot. Examples including, JavaScript, C++, C#, Flash and Swift.  </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The bot will be hosted by an out scoured virtual private sever to ensure a 24/7 up time allowing for people from all around the world in different time zones to have access to the bot and its complete functionality. By hosting the bot on a VPS we also envision it being much cheaper and more efficient to run than if our team were to host it ourself which would most likely use a greater amount of resources and be more costly than if we were to simply pay a service such as Amazon Web Services to host it for us. Upon successful completion of the bot we hope to allow more people to have access to python through discord and increase the amount of people learning and collaborating with their code.  </p>   
                                
                                <h3 class="text-center" style="text-align:left";>Motivation</h3>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>Our motivation for this project comes from doing Foundations of Computing at the University of Melbourne, where we would constantly be discussing various workshop problems in the subject’s Discord server. We’d always argue about correct solutions, because people either had typos or syntax errors, or the version of Python they were running had quirks that weren’t present in the version of Python we were recommended to run. A bot like this would have saved us all a lot of time, as we could collaborate on the code in the server, instead of working on it individually. Also, with the addition of using Trinket during ‘Introduction to programming’. Many users who are doing Bachelor of IT know how buggy it Is when trying to write a program and then trying to save it. This provides further reason of why implementing python bot on to Discord would be a good idea. </p>
                                <br>
                                
                                <h3 class="text-center" style="text-align:left">Landscape</h3>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>Upon researching information to create our bot, we have found that two competing discord bots already exist and perform vaguely similar functions to the bot we wish to create but both are lacking in some departments. The two bots being RTFM (created by a discontinued account) which most similarly mirrors our project idea and Python (created by Retox). When reviewing RTFM, we found that it performs the main function of running various coding languages including Python within the discord server, however, it was very hard to navigate and there was little to no help or guide to begin coding using the bot after adding it to the sever. RTFM was also running on an outdated version of Python which is almost 6 months behind and does not provide the option to update or select a Python version to use, nor is there any information on future patches. Furthermore, RTFM does not actually integrate coding within its bot but rather takes the input from the user, copies it to the website “https://tio.run/#”, where it is run and then the ouput is copied by the bot as an output for the user.   </p>
                                <br>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>“Python” the Bot only has one primary function, being to run a Python Script from a Github Repository as well as another repository called pypi.org. The Bot once again offers little to no help and guidance upon joining a sever and takes a bit of guess work to get code to run within discord. It also does not allow the user to type and run Python code within the Discord server itself, as such we do not view Python the Bot as a direct competitor of our project idea.  </p>
                                <br>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>Taking into consideration the functions and flaws of the two competing bots RTFM and Python, we envision creating a bot that has the core functionalities of both of the bots in a single entity with increased user friendliness and guidance when first inviting the bot into a sever. This will be done through a welcome message in the server’s designated main text channel, saying “Hello world!” and giving a list of commands that users can run including “help” which will list different areas in which the user might want more information on the functionalities of the bot. Furthermore, by integrating coding into the bot itself, the bot would not be reliant on an external website such as “https://tio.run/#” being up in order to process code and would only be reliant on the uptime of its host, in our case Amazon Web Services which has reliable backup severs in case of failures.  </p>
                                
                                <h2 class="text-center" style="text-align:center">Detailed Description</h2>
                                <br>
                                <h3 class="text-center" style="text-align:left">Aim</h3>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>The aim of the project is to create a Discord bot that runs Python code hosted by a virtual sever (hosted by Amazon Web Services). This would hopefully make Python more accessible to people who can’t install programs on their computer whether it be due to hardware requirements or any issues that have arisen from the including machines that are used in public spaces as Discord is able to run in most web browsers and on mobile devices. Hosting the bot off a virtual server would also ensure that the bot would run reliably with a 24/7 uptime and is capable of processing commands from multiple servers at once. This bot will attempt to fill a space for hobbyist and professional programmers to share and collaboratively work on Python in a more accessible environment like a discord sever, removing any system differences and issues.  </p>

                                <h3 class="text-center" style="text-align:left">Goals</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Write up a bot in python that can run Python code inputs and produce outputs similar to how it would perform in an IDLE. </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="text-align:justify";>As the aim of the entire project is to create a bot that can run python, this goal is the primary function of the entire bot. If this goal isn’t achieved first and foremostly the entire project would not be able to progress any further. The main point of Python running in an IDLE is so that beginner programmers as well as professional ones will be able to efficiently and effectively write code similarly to how they would outside of Discord as the format would be the same in any other IDE (integrated development environment.  </li>                                            
                                    </ul>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Ensure that the bot runs properly on a local system when hosted on a local network and system.  </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="text-align:justify";>This goal ensures that the bot behaves as intended when hosted and deployed in a discord sever. Local host testing allows us to make sure that the bot can read commands and inputs and produce proper outputs without any errors before it is deployed on a virtual sever for hosting. This also allows for any changes and bug fixes to be made can be done so quickly as the bot itself is stored locally on someone’s computer. </li>                                            
                                    </ul>     
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Deploy the bot on cloud infrastructure (most likely amazon web services) </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="text-align:justify";>This goal is the second primary step of the entire project. By hosting the bot, we will be able to utilise sever machines much stronger than any of hardware and allow for constant uptime as it would be very unfeasible and costly to keep a locally hosted system on for days at a time. This would also potentially allow the bot to run faster with a dedicated system supporting it.  </li>                                            
                                    </ul>   
                                    <br> 
                                    <li>Test the bot when hosted by virtual severs. </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="text-align:justify";>This step is simply to ensure that the bot behaves as expected when hosted from a virtual sever and is a semi-final step to allow for any bugs or issues that may arise when the bot is sever hosted and not locally hosted. Only one running iteration of the bot in a single discord sever will be tested to ensure that all key functionalities perform as expected or similarly to how the bot was performing when hosted by a local sever.  </li>          
                                    </ul>          
                                    <br> 
                                    <li>Add the bot to multiple severs at once and stress test the bot. </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="text-align:justify";>If the bot is able to successfully be deployed in multiple severs at once and run effectively and efficiently then we can then begin stress testing and seeing how well our virtual private sever can handle running multiple instances of python code at a time and returning outputs to several different locations. This is to test how powerful the sever and service we have chosen is and if it is able to effectively handle the amount of demand that could potentially be observed by users in the future.  </li>          
                                    </ul>  
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Add Java, C and other code integration </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="text-align:justify";>Once the bot is able to successfully run python in multiple different severs without any downtime or bugs then we can begin to program and add other coding languages and the commands to use them in the bot. Adding other languages to the bot will hopefully allow for more users of the bot and could even allow for potentially coding with multiple integrated languages for a single program. This goal could be ongoing for any additional programming languages that wish to be added by the community as well as to update existing codes as future versions are released.  </li>          
                                    </ul>  
                                    <br> 
                                    <li>Add GitHub functionality  </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="text-align:justify";>Adding the functionality for GitHub will be the last functionality goal which will allow for users to pull code from GitHub repositories and seamless run them through their bot on discord severs. This will hopefully allow for multiple users working on projects to quickly be able to demonstrate their code without going through the hassle of either screensharing themselves running the code on their own IDEs or by each member of the group individually downloading files from the repository to then run on their own simultaneously.  </li>          
                                    </ul>  
                                    
                                </ul>
                                <br>

                                <h3 class="text-center" style="text-align:left">Plans And Progress</h3>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>Our aim for this project is to design a discord bot that can facilitate python. This will be ideal for discord as it is a well-established platform for people to engage with others and share, talk and do digital face to face talks seamlessly. Discord already is used as a mean of social/collaborative communication. Our project entails users who need/want to share their programming concept to one another more convenient and efficient or people you need help with python problems to collectively help each other by sharing/streaming the python. As most people who are studying IT, Computer science, software engineering or just study at university probably already use/have Discord. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>During the beginning of our group assignment, we had to filter through the ideas that we had individually thought of during of first Introduction to Information technology. From the discussion we had as a group on which idea would be the best. For example, smart goalie gloves, an app designed specifically for cyclist, a barbering app, ______ and python bot on discord. We all resonated with the prospect of python being a bot on discord. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>Our idea of running python on discord was instigated through our discussion with trinket. Trinket is an online website running python. Within this website you are able to learn and try programming code. As Trinket is used in introduction to programming, the whole cohort needs to use this to finish set tasks that are required by the lecturer. From our experience of trinket being very finicky when trying to save work and quiet buggy we thought of how discord can run bots and through that realisation we thought of inputting python onto discord as a bot.     </p>
                                <br>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>Waiting for Response</p>

                                <h3 class="text-center" style="text-align:left">Roles</h3>         
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>It is sometimes useful to define roles for particular participants, such as Lead Developer, or Technical Designer, or User Interface Designer. It is also possible that roles are changed from week to week, depending on what needs to be done next. Have you defined any specific roles for your project? If so, describe and justify these. If not, describe your process and justify why there are no specific roles. </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>Through the first group assignment we have had the chance to understand how our group operates and their strength and weaknesses for completing task that are at par with their skill levels. We have a good grasp of our team's ability, we have assigned suitable roles for them. Nikila already has experience with programming due to studying the subject previously, therefore it was assigned as the chief program developer. He will be working on trying to implement python into discord. If Nikila is in need of any assistant, the bois have his back. Dylan and Varun are a proficient writer and designers. Hence, they are tasked with report designing and writing/editing and fixing text of the word document.  Zeeshan has adequate skills associated with html thus he is given the role chief of Web designer. Zeeshan once again will be making the website on the progress of our group idea. </p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify";>In terms of our scope and limit for this project we plan to create a simple discord bot that is able to run Python code when hosted locally on our own hardware and computers. The bot should be able to registers inputs and produce outputs similar to how it would on an IDLE. The bot would be activated through the use of a “!command” followed by a string of code written in the discord chat box which should adhere to standard python string format. After hitting “enter” and sending the code through to the bot, the bot should then be able to output a result that reflects the code inputted by the user. If the bot is unable to read and process the code, it will relay an error message and where the bot ran into the error. For example, if the user had forgotten to define a variable in their input, the bot would relay “SyntaxError: invalid syntax”, and the line in which it had occurred. </p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify";>Due to time constraints and difficulties in programming the bot, particularity in the bot taking considerably more time to get the code working due to us having to learn programming techniques and functions that were not taught to us in our first year programming subject. We have discovered that our limits in time constraints have led us to forgo many of our other key features of our bot, such as hosting it on VPS in this case Amazon Web Services. As this was one of the key features of our bot we would have liked to demonstrate this in our pitch by creating a fresh discord account and sever on a random computer at RMIT libraries and adding the bot to the sever and then demonstrating some code. We have also had to forego implementing the GitHub functionalities, once again due to time constraints, thus we will not be able to demonstrate pulling any code from GitHub repositories in our pitch video either. Finally, our last goal of wanting to implement other coding languages into the bot will have to be left out as we had unforeseen difficulties attempting to code an operational bot in Python alone, it would not be feasible to implement another coding language with our current skills and capabilities at present. </p>

This is the best ways for a project to succeed is the process of testing the project before it is released to networks and markets, because it is a successful project that needs to be planned. During the planning process for building a successful project, team members are consulted on the set plan to end the project with the best value and high quality. And that is through the implementation of testing for the system and the overall quality of production, then determining the elements that are used in the project so that the user must have the final consumption of the system. People who know the goal of the project can determine the elements required for the success of the project by documenting the requirements and integrating all the observations raised by the team members and after that a process of testing and analysing each part and evaluating the importance of the project's success. But we do have team members who are able to realize that the project will succeed and will fulfill the purpose for a user by implementing the Python code with the help of a discord bot. </p>
