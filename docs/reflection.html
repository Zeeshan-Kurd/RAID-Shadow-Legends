                                        <p style="text-align:justify;">The project was successfully completed, and we expected to accomplish such great work to show the project its best performance. But the work team finished the tasks on time, and we faced difficulties and challenges, but things were going great. Some committed to a specific time, and others were busy for personal reasons, for example, a few minutes late for the meeting. The work was planned and distributed to team members during the initiation and work on the project and we encountered problems in organizing the working hours. We also put in place a plan that divides the work into several stages, and I am proud of our work together to achieve the best result. I think the previous project gave us some experience in exploiting mistakes and benefiting from them and opened a path for us to succeed and work under the name of one group.  </p>
                                        <br>
                                        
                                        <h3 class="text-left">Nikila</h3>
                                        <p style="text-align:justify;">The project was successfully completed, with the group working well together to get it done by the deadline. Unlike last time, no group members were absent, which greatly improved our ability to delegate work and set deadlines that were met. We scheduled meetings regularly, although we didn’t have any official (and recorded) meetings until the 12th of May, just over 2 weeks before the assignment was due, due to people having connection difficulties and personal commitments that couldn’t be avoided. We could have improved our time management skills, as we definitely did more work in the latter half of the allocated time. Our communication skills were fairly good, with everyone actively using Teams.  </p>
                                        <br>
                                        
                                        <h3 class="text-left">Varun</h3>
                                        <p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
                                        <br>
    
                                        <h3 class="text-left">Zeeshan</h3>
                                        <p style="text-align:justify;">Since assignment 2, I believe that our group has improved quite a bit. First with the introduction of Paul, we had another set of hands to help us and another member to distribute work to (knowing that he would complete it, as in the previous assignment, one of our group members were consistently not contributing). We are also more on top of the work and more prepared than last assignment as we know that this assignment would not be a cakewalk. Due to our preparation, we were able to complete our work ahead of the required time that we set it to be complete. Another thing that has improved within our team is our communication. I can see that our team has become more involved, and we have developed as a group. The only downside so far, has been our meeting schedule. For a couple weeks, our group did not stick with the set times for meetings as people would not be able to attend these sessions. Instead, they were delayed and then we would just delay the next meeting again because another person could not attend, or we would just see each other the next day. Overall, I would say we worked really well as a team, as we all had our own skills and knowledge that we provided to complete the project.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        
                                        <h3 class="text-left">Paul</h3>
                                        <p style="text-align:justify;">The group seemed to work very fluently and cooperated well with a fair few scheduled meetings that definitely helped keep the project on track. Compared to my last group this one was extremely organised. Even though I came late to the team as a new member everyone was welcoming and easy to work with, I think everyone had unique knowledge and expertise in different areas and when everyone combined their skills and strengths it definitely worked well.  In class it seemed as we weren't as productive however most of class time was used for organisation and delegating parts, However, with a limited timeframe for the project and once a week classes it was surprising how we managed to communicate effectively despite most classes being online for me and only being on campus for one day. I feel like outside of class was very organised and productive. Everyone collaborated well on the document on Microsoft teams. I like how Microsoft teams has a doc editor which is very good when working in a group for a project when we all have to add to it in real time simultaneously. In other group assessments I have used google docs in the past and for this scenario this has been fantastic.  </p>
                                        <br>
    
                                        <h3 class="text-left">Group Reflection</h3>
                                        <p style="text-align:justify;">It was challenging attempting to assign roles and work for assignment 3 in the beginning as many of us were unsure as to what or where we could use our skills to develop the project and report. This led to our team, wasting away the first few weeks of the assignment as some of our team members were lost on where their place was in the team. This was however, rectified after a discussion with Anthony which led to more open communication in the group and back and forth rapport.  </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite listing it as something our group needed to improve on from Assignment 2, our time management skills are still not significantly better than last time, with us having to “rush” to complete the work during the last few remaining meetings and days before submission, although comparatively to Assignment 2 we did start a little earlier.   </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p style="text-align:justify;">It had also proved to be somewhat difficult in procuring a time when all 6 members of the group were able to be present for a productive group meeting, often there would be a single member who had mistaken the time of the meeting or had something come up, leaving only 4 or 5 team members in a call. This led to a lot of rescheduling and a few wasted night where work could have been completed instead of waiting 30 to 45 minutes for a reply from team members who had to inevitably cancel the meeting regardless. If possible, the group would have liked to have a few more recorded Microsoft Team meetings.  </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p style="text-align:justify;">Having a new team member who actively participated and offered their insights and ideas throughout the report was also very beneficial as a whole as it allowed new perspectives and skills to be added to the project, mainly knowledge in project management and the construction of time frames, which no other group member was able to produce at the time.  </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p style="text-align:justify;">The audit trail on the Git repository is not representative of the group’s efforts as a whole, as the main purpose of the repository was to contain the code that ran the website, which was spearheaded by Zeeshan. The other group members worked on the Word document, writing up the sections that were allocated during our team meetings, and on the AWS server that hosts the Discord bot. Therefore, the Git audit trail on GitHub is not representative of the group’s work on the assignment as the bulk of the work was completed in the shared Word document rather than on GitHub. </p>
