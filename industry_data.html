                                <p>The three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in our required skill set are: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Writing proficiency: Studies show that some recent graduates may struggle with writing skills to some degree. The Mangers always ask people when applying for jobs, you should have the skills of writing, such as Microsoft word or Google Docs. </li>
                                    <li>Public speaking: Statistics indicate that 40% of people have issues with public speaking, but in order to prove that we have skills in speaking. We need to challenge ourselves, by trying to speak our minds freely rather than keeping that idea tucked inside our heads. This will enable us to speak more fluently/comfortably among people which will eventually aid in public speaking. In addition to that, body language is one of the most important skills to speak fluently by looking, eye contact and hand movement. This is important as it helps us better convey our thoughts and feeling and people will understand how passionate about certain thing.</li>
                                    <li>Data analysis: People lack experience in using the Excel program because officials ask to analyse data coming from python or otherwise. The process of data analysis is one of the most important work in giant companies, including the financial affairs and sales management.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <p>Having viewed the data from Burning Glass, I would change my ideal job. I had thought that software Engineering would be a great prospect, but the data listed on Burning Glass had outlined that software engineering was not in much demand, as seen with only 539 positions listed. Assuming in the future need for engineers would remain steady, I would like to do electrical engineering as opposed to software engineering. As the world is becoming more tech-savvy, there would still be a need for engineers in the future.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h4>Dylan</h4>
                                <p>I was unable to find my specific occupation of IT consultant in the BurningGlass data but upon some research, I have discovered that a solutions architect is very similar and sometimes interchangeable with the position of an IT consultant. Thus, when viewing the data for prospects on becoming a “solutions architect”. I am pleased to say that my opinion on becoming an IT consultant is still very positive as they have one of the highest job prospects on the market and in fact placed first with 987 job postings. </p>
                                <br>
                                <h4>Nikila</h4>
                                <p>Having viewed the BurningGlass data and being unable to find my dream job in the ranking, I would say that becoming a CTO is an unrealistic goal, unless I plan on being a part of a startup. Thus, I am thinking of pivoting to Systems Administrator or Network Engineer as they are the lines of work that I am interested in, and they rank fairly highly on the list of top IT job titles in the BurningGlass data.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h4>Zeeshan</h4>
                                <p>After looking at the Burning Glass data, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed. The position that I had chosen as my ideal job was a backend software engineer. In the rankings in the burning glass data, software engineers were only ranked in the mid-section. So, it wasn’t a position that wasn't increasing in need nor was it a position that had no postings. It is just an average job that I think will be achievable for me. My opinion in the future may change depending on other factors and if my circumstances change but, in this instance, I believe that the Burning Glass data gave me more insight into other rather than completely change my mind.</p>

                                <h4>France</h4>
                                <p>By Burning Glass data, my opinion about the dream job of my future work has not changed, but it will several levels to achieve the goal. The position that I have chosen, which will be my dream job is the administrator of information technology system, but it is not easy to achieve this goal. It requires experience and several stages to achieve the goal.</p>
