                                        <p>Working in team RAID Shadow Legends has proven to be a challenging journey to find a method that works best for all of us. Initially we had adopted a very relaxed attitude when starting out having thought that this assignment was simply the same as assignment one but collated as a group. There was poor organisation right off the bat, with not many meetings scheduled and no real plan put in place until a few weeks before the due date. This led to a very sudden awakening where all members then adopted a much more alert and switched-on mentality, pushing out a huge amount of work in very short amounts of time. I am very impressed and surprised at how well we worked under the pressure of both an impending deadline as well as a group member being absent for most of the time. It was very pleasing to see and learn that each member of my team was extremely capable of producing a piece of work at a consistent standard when it came down to it all. It is certain that strong, consistent, communication and having a clear plan when starting out is essential to the success of a group and will be noted for the next assignment. </p>

                                        <h3 class="text-left">France </h3>
                                        <p>We had successfully completed the project and were not expecting to accomplish such great work which needed more scrutiny to show its best performance. But the work team completed the tasks on time, and we faced difficulties and challenges by setting meeting time. Some were committed to specified time, and some were busy for personal reasons. In the first weeks of the projects, we did not take advantage of the time for some. We realized that the project is easy it's like couple of words and does not require effort, but through starting and working on it, we faced problems in organizing work hours. We have also developed a plan that divides the work in many stages, but unfortunately, we have not adhered to it adequately. In the end, we learned new things in how to manage the project and benefit from our previous mistakes, but in the next project we will provide a required level by starting and planning for each step. And distribute the work to the team members and show it at the best level.</p>

                                        <p>The project was successfully completed by most members of the group, and I am happy with the final submission. We did some good work, and I was personally very happy with the IT professional interview that I conducted. The pace at which we did work could have been more consistent. I think that we weren’t expecting a lot of work originally, so we wasted the first several weeks that were allocated to the project, time that could have been used far more efficiently to make the assignment even better and more beautified. Communication could also be improved a bit, as not everyone was consistently on Teams. I found it super surprising that a member of the group effectively ghosted the group, essentially doing no work, and continually making suspicious excuses about his absence. I’ve learned that I/we need to be much more proactive about setting meeting dates and setting strict deadlines to have certain things done by, otherwise things don’t get done on time. </p>

                                        <p>Overall, I believe our work as a group was like an upstart hill. We had a few issues sorting the group chemistry. Such as finding times we all can have a call and attending classes so that we could have a face-to-face discussion. However, as weeks went by our group chemistry improve due to the realization of the amount of work that must be completed and the standard it must be done. We started to all pick times we were available to get some work done and we were able to allocate work to be done during our own spare time. One major thing that would have helped our efficiency to work, would have been if everyone would have attended the weekly practical lessons, so that we all as a team could have discussed the work that should be done. What was surprising was our ability get the work done in the limited time we had as a group and our willingness to allocate parts of the project to one another.  One thing I learnt about this group was how disorganized we were as a team. </p>

                                        <h3 class="text-left">Zeeshan</h3>
                                        <p>At first, we all believed that this assignment would be a cake walk. That was a big mistake. Only on the second last week before the due date did we come to realise how big of a project this would end up being. At first, I thought that group work would be really fun and easy as we would work with new people and the workload would be divided between us. This was somewhat true as I found it hard to connect and participate in group meetings at the start of our assignment, but towards the end I started to participate more in meetings and present my ideas. A problem that was created throughout the weeks was that one of our members were constantly absent for our meetings and in person classes. Eventually we came to the decision to eject him from the group. Anthony was kind enough to allow us to ignore the section that was required of him to complete. I feel as though at the start of our project we did not communicate or achieve as much as we could have. Next assessment we should be more prepared and try to spread out our workload across the weeks. </p>

                                        <h3 class="text-left">Group Reflection</h3>
                                        <p>Unfortunately, our group had a member of our team recurringly not show up to meetings and would be frequently hard to contact. Out of the six online meetings and five in-class sessions we had to work on assignment two, Milan had only attended one in-class session at the beginning and one online meeting (meeting two), after which, he had proceeded to not add anything to the report despite specific allocation and deadlines. It proved to be very difficult attempting to work around a group member who we believed were to be present or had hoped to return and produce some level of work.  </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>Another vice that occurred was disorganisation due to lack of present members in class and online, and due to an underestimation of the volume of work required. This had placed a great amount of stress on the group when we realised how much time we had left to complete a large volume of work. But conversely, this sense of pressure also pushed us to schedule more meetings and put in more hours to complete the work so that we could submit a final product on time. </p>    
                                        <br>
                                        <p>Despite this initial disorganisation and an absent member, we had discovered that the remainder of the team are able to work extremely well under a tight deadline and significant pressure. Everyone was able to perform their allocated tasks to a determined deadline with minimal tardiness and produce work of a consistent level.</p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>Upon reflecting our progression throughout this assignment, it is clear to all of us that there are many areas of teamwork that we can improve on for assignment 3, mainly organisation and ensuring an early start so that we have more time and headroom to work around any problems which may occur.  </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>The audit trail on the Git repository reflects how our team had decided to divide the work into our key strengths. Allocating the coding of the website to Nikila and Zeeshan who had better designed websites in their A1’s out of all the group members and allocating the remaining group members to work on formatting the report into a more cohesive and visually appealing document. Therefore, the Git audit trail on GitHub is not representative of the group’s work on the assignment as the bulk of the work was completed in the shared Word document rather than on GitHub. </p>
